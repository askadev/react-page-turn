## [Open Features](https://github.com/askadev/react-page-turn/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aspec) / [Open Bugs](https://github.com/askadev/react-page-turn/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)

## Philosophy

This project will be developed in the open following [published specs](https://github.com/askadev/react-page-turn/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Aspec). Hack away during downtime at an Ask a Dev meetup, tackle an [open feature](https://github.com/askadev/react-page-turn/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Aspec+is%3Aopen+) with a mentor or mentee, or fly solo. Collaborative projects are teaching opportunities and a way for the international Ask a Dev community to connect.
